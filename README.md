# A PyTorch Implementation of Image Recoloring with cGANs

This repository contains the code for building and training the pix2pix model using PyTorch. The model is trained on the Microsoft COCO Dataset and the purpose of the model is recoloring grayscale images, although it can be used for other tasks.

**Requirements**: <tt>PyTorch 1.13.0+cu117</tt>
